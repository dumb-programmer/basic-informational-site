# basic-informational-site
  A webserver which serves static files on routes `/`, `/contact-me`, `/about` and 404 page on other incorrect routes. This project demontrates my understanding of creating a basic webserver, and working with files in NodeJS using express.
# Server setup
  To get started make sure you have the latest version of NodeJS installed. Run the following command to start the server.
  ```bash
    $ node start
  ```
# Libraries
- fs
